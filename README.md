# MEMORIALIST
#### Video Demo:  <[URL HERE](https://youtu.be/23uFh-g_GjE)>
#### Description:
This project is created to help users with learning foreign languages. I've recently moved to Germany. And it is hard for me to memorise a lot of new words. So using this project I can create my user, add cards with specific words and it's translation. And then I can go through all the cards to memorise them.

So from the code side there is app.py file, with which I can basically run project and navigate through the pages. There is also helper.py file where helper functions are located.

There is a Template folder that contains a list of .html files, that represent different pages or the project. index.html page is the main one, then register.html, login.html, dashboard.html, study.html. There is also layout.html file, that helps to have the same layout at all pages and not repeat it everytime.

There is also card.db file with database to store created cards for specific user. And init_db.py file that helps to use this db in the app.

There is also Static folder, that contains Images folder with all needed images for the project. And there is a styles.css file, that stores all the information about style of the project.
